Fireplace is a concept store for one-of-a-kind art and indie fashion.
A curation of designers are given the space they need to shine in the gallery on the most coveted stretch of Bleecker street. 
Mid-month, every month a new display of artworks is kicked off by a performing art show that Fireplace hosts and plans alongside a guest curator.
